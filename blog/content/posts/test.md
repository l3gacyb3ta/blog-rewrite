So as those who have been following me may know, I keep just upgrading my blog while not really writing for it. The problem with writing for this blog is that, as much as I love VSCode, it's not the most effective for blog post writing. So I have been shopping around for a CMS that'll work with my existing blog because I do _not_ want to migrate my blog _again_. And I found this:  
[forestry.io](https://forestry.io)

Forestry is a git-based CMS that uses the markdown files that already exist in my blog and it integrates with GitHub, so I can just write a post in a WordPress-like UI:

^ That's me writing this post!

Forestry is cool because it can manage a whole bunch of stuff. That bar you see in the middle-left of the screen is actually the front matter of this post! Forestry makes front matter super easy, so that's one thing I don't need to worry about anymore. It can also manage the media of the blog, you can specify the location of the files in your repo.

Speaking of repos, the git integration is amazing. I personally use GitHub for my open-source needs, so my website is hosted on GitHub Pages. Forestry meshes amazingly with basically any git solution, so it of course works great with my blog. 

Basically what I'm saying is that I have fallen in love with another piece of software.

Thanks for reading,
